# CS-449-Project

The best way to run this program is to first create a character by pressing the create a character button. 
After creating a character of your choosing, confirm the character to set it into the program. 
If you do not confirm your character or hit back while in the create a character screen an error message will show. 
Once your character has been successfully created, you can start the game or access your Stats Page by pressing the upper menu and 
selecting Stats. You can return to the previous page by pressing the back button from this page. 
After you decide to start the game, hit the next button to go through the game’s plot line. 
Once combat has started you cannot continue the plotline until the combat is over. 
Combat will end once the enemy dies, the player dies, or the player decides to flee. 
Combat consists of the player and the enemy taking turns attacking. 
The player can look through their inventory, fight, or flee. 
The inventory will show what the player currently has and will ask if they want to use a health potion. 
A health potion will increase the player’s health by five hit points. 
If the player chooses to fight, they can choose a first level, second level, or a melee attack. 
The corresponding attacks for the player will show if they decide to use a first or second level spell. 
Once the player has finished their turn, they will have to hit the end turn button to confirm it. 
Once the player confirms it, it will be the opponents turn. Play will continue this way until the game has ended. 
Hitting the back button from the Game screen will delete your character information and cause the user to create a new character 
and start the game over.
